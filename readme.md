## Golem

Golem is an ERC20 token launched on the BSC network. Golem is designed to be a store of value to replace the Certificate of Deposit as the blockchain counterpart of that financial product used in traditional financial markets. Golem is also designed to leverage off the emerging DeFi (Decentralised Finance) ecosystem in cryptocurrencies within the BSC network.

Golem uses the BSC network for the transaction layer (sending and receiving Golem tokens, as well as interacting with the Golem smart contract), whilst the consensus code and staking mechanism is contained in the Golem smart contract.

Golem allows a user to stake his or her Golem coins for a share of the new Golem coin issuance, or inflation and contains features designed to incentivize behaviors that encourage price appreciation and disincentivize behaviors that encourage harm to the price. The Golem smart contract penalizes stakers for ending their stake early and rewards them for staking larger amounts of Golem for longer periods.
