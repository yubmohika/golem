A golem is an animated, anthropomorphic being in Jewish folklore, which is entirely created from inanimate matter (usually clay or mud).
The most famous golem narrative involves Judah Loew ben Bezalel, the late 16th-century rabbi of Prague. 
According to Moment magazine, "the golem is a highly mutable metaphor with seemingly limitless symbolism. 
It can be a victim or villain, Jew or non-Jew, man or woman—or sometimes both. 

Over the centuries, it has been used to connote war, community, isolation, hope, and despair."

**Earliest stories**

The oldest stories of golems date to early Judaism. In the Talmud (Tractate Sanhedrin 38b), Adam was initially created as a golem when his dust was "kneaded into a shapeless husk". Like Adam, all golems are created from mud by those close to divinity, but no anthropogenic golem is fully human. Early on, the main disability of the golem was its inability to speak. Sanhedrin 65b describes Rava creating a man (gavra). He sent the man to Rav Zeira. Rav Zeira spoke to him, but he did not answer. Rav Zeira said, "You were created by the sages; return to your dust".

During the Middle Ages, passages from the Sefer Yetzirah (Book of Creation) were studied as a means to create and animate a golem, although little in the writings of Jewish mysticism supports this belief. It was believed that golems could be activated by an ecstatic experience induced by the ritualistic use of various letters of the Hebrew alphabet[6] forming a "shem" (any one of the Names of God), wherein the shem was written on a piece of paper and inserted in the mouth or in the forehead of the golem.[7]

A golem is inscribed with Hebrew words in some tales (for example, some versions of Chełm and Prague, as well as in Polish tales and versions of the Brothers Grimm), such as the word emét (אמת, "truth" in Hebrew) written on its forehead. The golem could then be deactivated by removing the aleph (א) in emét,[8] thus changing the inscription from "truth" to "death" (mét מת, meaning "dead").

The earliest known written account of how to create a golem can be found in Sodei Razayya by Eleazar ben Judah of Worms of the late 12th and early 13th centuries.[9]

Samuel of Speyer (12th century) was said to have created a golem.

One source credits 11th-century Solomon ibn Gabirol with creating a golem,[10] possibly female, for household chores.

In 1625, Joseph Delmedigo wrote that "many legends of this sort are current, particularly in Germany."
